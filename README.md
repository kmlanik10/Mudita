In this example, we'll build a full-stack application that uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) powered by [Pinecone](https://pinecone.io) to deliver accurate and contextually relevant responses in a chatbot.

RAG is a powerful tool that combines the benefits of retrieval-based models and generative models. Unlike traditional chatbots that can struggle with maintaining up-to-date information or accessing domain-specific knowledge, a RAG-based chatbot uses a knowledge base created from crawled URLs to provide contextually relevant responses.

Incorporating Vercel's AI SDK into our application will allow us easily set up the chatbot workflow and utilize streaming more efficiently, particularly in edge environments, enhancing the responsiveness and performance of our chatbot.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a context-aware chatbot that provides accurate responses without hallucination, ensuring a more effective and engaging user experience. Let's get started on building this powerful tool ([Full code listing](https://github.com/pinecone-io/pinecone-vercel-example/blob/main/package.json)).
